       "  'text': 'The only reason I didn\\'t give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we\\'d only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn\\'t be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \\n\\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn\\'t on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \\nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.',\n",

       "  'text': \"It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai!

This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.\\n\\nTo sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. \\n\\nPlease note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)\",\n",

We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it's rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don't mark them up 5x like most places! \\n\\nOur waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent.

I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.\\n\\nThe sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.',\n",

She was thoughtful and engaging! \\n\\nThe black bean burger was dry. Sweet potato fries were good. \\n\\nToday while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. \\n\\nThis entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. \\n\\nNo one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled. \\n\\nNot ok!!!\",\n",

Along the way we stopped for food tastings . Everything was great,  especially the stone soup company Cuban sandwich!

ITV is the kind of place that i dream about, beautiful small room, dimly lit but you can see ( as opposed to some places) and you want to see everything.  Everything in the room is beautiful including a lot of the staff, (im trying to give you the full picture here).   First thing to hit the table (or bar in this case) was a three dollar beef fat biscuit that was the best thing ive eaten in this city all year.  I verbally communicated that message to Chef Nick Elmi who graced us with his presence in the dining room (just as before at Laurel).    We went on to eat many more things which i will try to name now... Stars were Foie with Apricot Miso, Pork Cheeks with some insanely good vegetables, trout pumpernickel soldiers and one of the best cocktails ive had in a damn long time, the ouroboros.   The are playing around with cold smoking things in there and on their BAR MENU!   Honestly, place is just terrific and i meant to write this review sooner but hey... better late than never.  Now that i think of it, im getting hungry... maybe ill head to East Passyunk for some of the best this city has to offer!',\n",

I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.\\n\\nNote though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.\\n\\nNext, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3.\",\n",

We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. \"It was totally worth it,\" he later told me, \"Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.\"\\n\\nAll because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can\\'t vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I\\'ve had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. \\n\\nI kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food, drinks and service. I give this restaurant my strongest recommendation, and it\\'s the first place I\\'m going when I next visit Tampa.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Super lunch option\\nWatch out for the yoga mats\\nYou won't miss the meat\\n\\nLunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.\\n\\nHaven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.\\n\\nOkay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.\\n\\nMy only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.\",\n",

I practically tried everything for breakfast and have come to the conclusion that this is the spot for breakfast. I have one gripe though, the monte cisto is not worth the price and is way over priced. I know truffle oil is used but that should not be the reason its so damn expensive. one egg, one piece of toast and some sauce. Don't ever order it, not worth it unless they drop the price $5. everything else is worth it taste great. Jebbs open face and the huevos rancheros are my favs. Enjoy. oh and the coffee is addicting.

       "  'text': \"This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\\n\\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\\n\\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\\n\\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \\n\\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\\n\\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The long and the short of it: A romantic little BYOB in Newtown Square that hits the mark in several areas. Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!\\n\\nAnd now for a full review:\\n\\nI have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\\n\\nOn my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\\n\\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\\n\\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\\n\\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\\n\\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \\n\\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \\n\\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\\n\\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\\n\\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\\n\\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'First of all, I think this might be my first Yelp review about \"fast food.\" It\\'s not a genre I ever eat unless I\\'m forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.\\n\\nThe service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby\\'s cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  \\n\\nThe food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  \\n\\nI am a fan!  This place doesn\\'t quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!',\n",

We moved to the other side of the restaurant (still outside) and the kids made there way over to us and continued playing. We couldnt get away. We went to a table inside. Food was terrible. Steak was fatty and overcooked and mashed potatoes werent fresh. The waitress was about the only thing good about this place. She agreed on the steak and took it back. Came back with chicken as I asked for and it was like biting into rubber bands. All in all it was a disaster and I'll never return. 1 star for the waitress.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\\nBut whats this? \\nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\\n\\nNo.\\nNo, it can\\'t be! \\nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\\n\\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\\nWhy am I here?\\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\\n\\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that\\'s silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \\n\\nZaika \\'s appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\\n \\nI\\'ve become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn\\'t too soft. It\\'s nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don\\'t mind at all.\\n\\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \\nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\\n\\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\\n\\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \\n\\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\\n\\nP.S.\\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \\nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.',\n",

       "  'text': \"My boyfriend and I both decided to try Jesse's for the first time after we'd both grown up in the Brandon area and neither of us had ever been, and really hadn't heard much about the restaurant. \\n\\nWe dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. \\n\\nOur server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \\n\\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \\n\\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \\n\\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \\n\\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!\",\n",

JB Dawson's is far better.\\nAwesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  \\n\\nFor our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. \\n\\nShortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.\\n\\nFor our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.\\n\\n I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.\\n\\nGreat first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.\\n\\nWe'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Went to see Star Wars Rogue One yesterday in 3D.  Buying the tickets was a breeze, and the atmosphere was inviting.  Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that\\'s when I noticed something wasn\\'t right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors\\' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a \"closed-system\" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn\\'t the first time he\\'s heard this from a customer.  I\\'ve seen normal movies at this location before, but this was my first, and last experience with their 3D in room #1.',\n",

I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like \"I don\\'t like food sitting on the table.\" .....we didn\\'t even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn\\'t stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said \"yes!\" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn\\'t sit at this table any longer!! We then left.\\n\\nI worked in restaurants for a long time and I\\'m pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service.

Not the biggest fan of the lettuce cause it's gets all wilted but add some hot sauce and it's a meal in itself!!! I got also got the taco lunch special (2 pork tacos and rice) and that was good. Besides the amazing service from the sweet lady, the salsa was way sweet! Wasn't the biggest fan but everything is def fresh! And the pineapple water is a must. I don't like pineapples but I read reviews and just had to try it and thank u guys!

       "  'text': 'Dearest Reader,\\n\\nPlease allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \\n\\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn\\'t quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\\n\\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can\\'t wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.\\n\\nWarning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. \\n\\nAll in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.\\n\\nStill dreaming of that burger,\\nChris M.',\n",

Fortunately though, their lunch is delicious! I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! \\n\\nSad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!\\n\\nThe patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum\\na homemade red velvet cupcake with a candle, which LOOKED amazing, and she thought was delicious. Another win at Wildflower, would love to come back for breakfast sometime.\",\n",

Overall, as someone already stated they have great apps but the entrees are left to be desired.\\nConsidering each entree costs ~$8, you get what you pay for. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was bad. Way too sweet with no spicy kick to it. We also ordered the Seafood Crispy Noodles, Pearl Noodles, and a Beef rice dish. All were really mediocre. The Indian pancakes and chicken satay apps were great though. Idk why the entrees were so lackluster. I'm sad I didn't enjoy it more but I'm glad the total was cheap for a night out.\",\n",

We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).\\n\\nSpasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.\\n\\nThey start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.\\n\\nI started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.\\n\\nSpasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in Media!\",\n",

Almost every time I have been here with my fiancé or friends, it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside, outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told, and when asking management what was going on, we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was \"too bad\". Staff is rude and far from attentive, though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service. No longer wasting our time and money here, and we advise our friends and family to do the same. It is too much of a hit-and-miss to come here and attempt to have a good time.',\n",

       "  'text': 'oh Millers, how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. \\n\\nfriends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. \\n\\nhubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. \\n\\nour server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. \\n\\nperhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.',\n",

The meat is sliced and minced into tiny little pieces, maximizing surface area.  Then the cheese is melted throughout so it covers most of the steak and ensures a heavenly consistency and flavor.  The onions and mushrooms are up to snuff as well.  It's greasy enough to slide down your throat but not so much that it's a mess to eat.  I can't attest to the other menu items, but that hardly matters.

Great atmosphere and feel to this place - Kind of an art house meets coffee house meets Animal House environment. Very unusual. In a good way. The service was relaxed, social and great. The beverages were delicious and the menu was quite interesting. \\nI so wanted the food to be much better than it was. Tried the Bird and Pig, a specialty grilled cheese and a couple apps. Everything was good but not great. In truth, if I was judging on food alone, there would be three stars instead of four. But the atmosphere and the staff clearly deserved the extra star, and I'll head back to try some other items on the menu next visit.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I really wanted to like this place and heard about it during lent when I had given up meat. I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), \\na bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: \\n\\nThe chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. \\n\\nThe sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. \\n\\nThe mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. \\n\\nThe bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. \\n\\nThe new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.\\n\\nI gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.\",\n",

My salad had one bite of potato salad and two items in the salad - tomato and pepper tasted off. I had to spit them out. My daughter got a fajita bowl with chicken.

       "  'text': \"Wow!  I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.\",\n",

Main dishes were a burger grass fed beef with fries coated with truffles dusting. Burger was humongous!  Looked good smelled good and tasted good.

Boy do they deliver, the croissants were buttery, nice and flaky, and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly, the baker \"Nico\" is french, and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste, it\\'s definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly, it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :). The one negative thing is they are too far from me, 45 mins drive, but to satiate my sweet tooth, I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this bakery.',\n",

Makes me wonder if Daniel O. went to the same place we did.\\n\\nThis is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is \"let\\'s go back and work our way through the menu\" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband\\'s broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won\\'t be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn\\'t know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.\\n\\nIt\\'s a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.  For those who rely on public transportation, you can get off the subway at Broad & Oregon, then walk back a block to Broad & Porter.  Make a reservation, though because it can be a popular place.  You also want to make sure you have time to have a relaxing meal and make your event in time.',\n",

I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.\\n\\nAs if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! \\n\\nUnfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. \\n\\nAt $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don\\'t have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don\\'t always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they\\'ll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). \\n\\nI\\'ve ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren\\'t really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it\\'s called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It\\'s gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!\\n\\nThe service is generally pretty attentive (once you\\'re seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value',\n",

       "  'text': 'Philadelphia, I love you.  Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi\\'s (NYC) and Grimaldi\\'s (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad\\'s Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He\\'s lucky I didn\\'t stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could\\'ve eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I\\'m in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri\\'s other restaurants, but I\\'m checking them out next time I\\'m in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!',\n",

Okay, arrived at 7 pm with reservations and was seated in the dungeon. Fine. We ordered queso fundido with chorizo and got a weird looking cheese skillet with tortillas NOT chips. Odd! So had to ask for chips. Should've asked for a trash can. So we asked for some salsa to dress it up a bit -- that took an hour and I'm not exaggerating! The salsa was a thick mushy mess. Could turn the bowl upside down and nothng would've come out. Our food took an hour and a half, too. By that time, we were full on chips -- which were the only good thing on the menu! Oh... My favorite part... I ordered a side of beans and rice to go with my carne asada tacos -- which were more like unseasoned beef tips -- and I got a bowl of hard WHITE rice with refried beans on top. WHITE rice??? Seriously?!\\n\\nTerrible! Dont waste your time. Taco Bell serves better food than this and that isn't saying much! Service was just as bad!!\",\n",

Both tables were demanding as hell and already said loudly to eachother that they weren't tipping because of x, y and z reasons, and then were dumbfounded that there's a gratuity on their bill (it says it in the menu, anything over $50) their server, smaller girl so with purple hair, carried upwards of 4 plates at once, explained the menu perfectly and had an eagle eye for every table in her section and dealt with ridiculous complaints like a true professional.

Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.\\n\\nThe service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized. I prefer the hole in the wall places where I am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more.\",\n",

The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad and Alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza. The alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks.

I literally had to pry her away from ordering more; I don't blame her at all though because the food was damn good. I had the curry tofu wrap and it was delicious. The place is pretty small with limited seating so a lot of people were taking (and I'm assuming regularly take) their food to go, so I'd be wary of this if you're wanting to sit in. \\n\\nBut yeah this place rocks. Their kale lemonade alone is worth the 5 stars. Next time we're in Philly this place will be among the first in which we stuff our faces.\",\n",

I could see it getting really busy (especially since there are only about 10 tables available), so I would definitely suggest making reservations if you're going on a weekend.  The service wasn't bad, but when I asked some questions about some dishes on the menu, I had a hard time understanding what she was trying to say.  \\n\\nOkay now to the main course - food!  For appetizers, we ordered the pan seared pork dumplings and sui mai.  Both appetizers were delicious and the dipping sauce was really good.  For the entrees, we ordered the sweet & sour chicken, pan fried noodle with shrimp, and pan fried noodle with beef and black bean sauce.  The sweet & sour chicken was awful - more sweet than sour - and the vegetables in it were really undercooked (pretty much raw).  (I do have to admit that I like things spicy, so maybe this dish just wasn't for me.)  For both pan fried noodle dishes, they were blah with a side of blah.  The beef dish was supposed to be spicy, but I just didn't taste any heat.  I left here full, but unsatisfied.\",\n",

The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn\\'t they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don\\'t want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \\n\\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.

Now I know the answer, and the answer is- not much. At least in terms of decor. There is a gumball machine, 2 empty candy machines, plus a counter to order at and that's pretty much it. Also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood. There were some frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs- but not else. Still, I threw caution to the winds of Tasker Street and put in an order.\\n\\nI didn't want to go for fried seafood, so the sandwiches and platters were out.\\n\\nI got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce ($9.50). Mussels are one of those things I like making at home, but it is way too hot for that right now. . My main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells - 9!   It was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy, broth. As the place is to-go only- they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders, nothing was spilled.\\n\\nRemember when I said I didn't want anything fried, well that's not ever actually true. So I ended up sneaking in 2 fried shrimps. Not bad, but not worth $1.25 each.\",\n",

The bathrooms were filthy. There are 2 and one was not usable due to all of the paper towels that had been put into the toilet (there was no toilet paper). The other one was usable but also no toilet paper. Our server, Ashley, was not interested in providing any semblance of customer service...RUDE! We had a simple question about the beers on special and she became quite defensive. My daughter spilled her drink, which I realize is a pain in the ass for the restaurant and server (although we were outside so it wasn't that big a deal). We apologized profusely but she didn't even try to hide her annoyance. Finally, the chicken quesadilla should have been labeled the gristle quesadilla....more fat than actual meat...yuck. We love the proximity of this place to where we live and it was great in the past but not anymore...will likely not return...not with so many better quality restaurants in Northern Liberties and Fishtown.\",\n",

We had many options on the type of milk and sweetener is available. They had limited food items available being mostly donuts this morning. We opted for a piece of the vegan banana bread to share. Iced coffee came out quickly and are banana bread and we went outside to sit with and realize there is no area connected to this restaurant for outdoor seating. The restaurant next-door however was not yet open so we sat at one of their tables thinking no one would mind. It would be nice if the coffee house itself had its own outdoor seating. Are iced coffee was very good and hit the spot. The vegan banana bread was good but seemed very dense to me. I'll be back another time to try some more of the fancy coffee they have available here. I'm hoping that they will add to the food menu as well as a try to not eat donuts most days. Maybe a breakfast sandwich or some other option than a pastry would be good.\",\n",

This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. \\n\\nI'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... \\n\\nThe guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. \\n\\nI should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  \\n\\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!\",\n",

The place is open 24/7\\nThe ATMS are no surcharge (yes!!!)\\nThey place really, really cool music!\\n\\n(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)\\n\\nGripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  \\n\\nGripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.\\n\\nMajor points for:  \\n*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  \\n*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!\\n*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.\\n*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!\\n*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.\\n\\nI do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  \\n\\n\\nFor a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  \\n\\nDoes this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  \\nAlso, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)\\nOverall:  This place is awesome based on the music selection and friendly staff working 24/7.  This store does a lot right!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.\",\n",

Only once we checked in and changed into our robes and inquired about the hot tubs and pools, were we told they were closed. The other women in the locker room were equally surprised at the closures. The whole spa smelled like cement powder and the only spa option for is while we waited was the sauna/steam room. When we asked for a refund, the spa manager, Dawn, was aggressively rude to my mother as she said refunds were not an option. She offered us day credits but since we are from out of town, this wasn't a viable option. Only once we asked for the hotel manager and waited for almost 30 minutes at the checkin desk did someone (not Dawn) apologize for the hassle and let us know we wouldn't be charged for the treatments we didn't receive in a mostly facility unprepared to host us anyway. My prior experience with the spa was positive but now that they were so secretive about the true state of the facility and so stubborn about making it right, I can truly say I will never give them another chance... And what a bummer because it was our Christmas present. :(\",\n",

The \"grilling\" process did not sear or seal the tortilla, and there were no grill marks or cheese melting that would evidence any type of honest grilling process.   \\n\\nThe idea of eating room temp eggs and chicken really weirded me out... but I had a bout $8 bucks invested in this roll of disappointment, I was already at my office and did not have an alternative breakfast...so I begrudgingly ate most of it.\\n\\nIf I go back for breakfast, I will stick with the smoothies.   those seem to be easy enough to pull off and very nutritious.',\n",

Breakfast was average, same with lunch, which was a choice because the first two places we picked were closed for lunch hours. For the lunch visit, we split a patty melt and a corned beef sandwich. The menu made it sound like the corned beef was a hot open faced sandwich, but it was nothing more than cold lunchmeat and dressing. Everything was bland and under seasoned. Wait staff hung out by the counter a lot to talk, but seemed friendly when they approached our table.

The special place Cactus holds in my heart is for one thing: Margarita Mondays.\\n\\nI walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.\\n\\nThe service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.\\n\\nMy most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.\\n\\nIt's not the best place around by any stretch, but if you ever need to unwind after a long Monday, you'll find me at Cactus.\",\n",

We sat for ten minutes without acknowledgement and were finally greeted by the frantic manager. He brought us waters and promised a server would be over immediately. Another five minutes passed before our overbearing server arrived. She only had two tables. She tried to offer us more time to look over the menu, which we had practically memorized by then. We put in our dinner orders right away. When she gave us our dishes a few minutes later, she disappeared. We were finished our meals and sitting for 8-10 minutes when she reappeared. By that time, she asked about dessert and tried to go get us a menu but again, we knew we couldn't let her out of our sight without losing her forever. When we placed our orders, we agreed to each other to ask for the check when she dropped the desserts. Of course, she had a runner come to our two top with our desserts. One and a half hours for a dinner/dessert for two (no drinks) in a quiet restaurant is absurd. The food was fine, but not worth the frustration and invisible customer status.\",\n",

Because of the rain and humidity we decided to sit inside. Well if the smell of dirty dish water didn't turn me off the noise of the kitchen sure did. We were given a table right in front of it. Beyond that I ordered eggs Benedict which was less than spectacular for $10 and my wife got the small something and it had some potatoes, 2 eggs scrambled and a muffin that also cost $10. When you add this all on top of the fact that we had to scream at each other to have a conversation and that the a/c was dripping on our table it didn't make for a great experience.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'d heard the hype. Seen the NY Times article. Nevertheless I was skeptical. Mainly because most people have at best, two reference points for donuts, Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.\\n\\n Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.\\nThe donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.\\n\\nThe Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.\\n\\nThe caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I\"d imagined.\\n\\nThe pina colada-The donut I though I\\'d enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven\\'s 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don\\'t use that term lightly.\\n\\nThe halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I\\'d never had halva before, but I liked it.\\n\\nBelieve the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I\\'ve had.',\n",

The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.\\n\\nOn this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages... \\n\\nI ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.\\n\\nAnother steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.\\n\\nThe manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.\\n\\nWe will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.\\n\\nOne shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues, but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again.\",\n",

Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. \\nThe layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn\\'t slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn\\'t need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.\\nThe food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means \"before\" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee\\'s. \\nFor our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. \\nOur main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. \\nWe did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it\\'s okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn\\'t the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso. \\nOverall I recommend this place, mainly for the main courses, but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini\\'s their 5th star. I hope I can!',\n",

I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar.  \\n\\nFor starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!  The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins.  \\n\\nI woke up the next day, thinking about the burger I consumed the night before at the Village Whiskey.  Hands down, this is ONE of the best burgers I have eaten!\",\n",

Having heard a lot of good things about Limoncello we thought we'd give it a shot. I'm so glad we did, because this place rocks!\\nI haven't eaten at an Italian restaurant this good in a long time. The food was outstanding. My family is big eaters, and we did WORK! Let's start with the appetizers. I had the Calamari Fritti, which was amazing. I am a big fan of dipping sauces and loved that it came with three! I tried some of the others which were the Ariancini, clams, and mussels. All of which were equally good, especially the mussels. Next we split up a chicken ala vodka pizza. It was crisp and tasty. I got a chicken tortellini soup next. It was great and I loved that the tortellini was al dente, and not the mush commonly found in soup. Finally I got my entree, the Pescatore, which considered of a mix of seafood over linguine. I chose the white wine sauce, and it was delicious. Oh, and how could I forget, the complimentary bruschetta and limoncello was the perfect beginning and end to our meal.\\nI can't write this review and not mention how phenomenal the service was. We had an 8:15 reservation and were greeted by the hostess and told our table would be a few minutes. She was very kind. While we were waiting the manager came up to us, offered us drinks, and told us the next available table was ours. It was nice knowing that they cared we were waiting. After a few minutes we were seated. Our waiter was GREAT. He was very professional, told us about the specials, didn't need to write anything down, and kept our drinks full the whole meal. What more could you ask for in a waiter?\\nBottom Iine here folks, if you want great italian cuisine and great service, then check out Limoncello!\",\n",

I recently tried a soba noodle bowl with chicken and it was yummy. Perfect size with a side of baguette. And I absolutely love the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. Wish it was around all year!! Losing one star because it is always freezing in here despite the time of year. Not a comfortable eating atmosphere.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I was looking for a restaurant in the city that offered a good steak at a reasonable cost.  I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.  \\n\\nThe Good:\\nI have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.   \\n\\nThe Not So Good:\\nThe decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?\\n\\nIf you want great steaks for a good price, go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place, and I can only hate it because I used to love it.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive. I\\'m admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager Ali, who --when I asked why my room wasn\\'t made up despite my  calling housekeeping, stopping by the front desk and activating the green \"make up room\" button -- behaved as though making the bed, cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job. In less time than I spent requesting the service, i could have cleaned my own room. Worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button. A lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on.   \\n\\nNo one knows the hotel policies or amenities and I got a different answer every time I asked a question. \\n\\nThe binder in the room indicates that I can either use the in-room safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk. When I asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box, they said they had no idea what I was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service. The front desk said there\\'s no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho I was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box. No one has read their own guest binder. \\n\\nThe binder and literature also says there is a pool. There is not. There is not a even single place to sit or walk outside, and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years. They could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air, since there are no balconies or windows that open. \\n\\nThere was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third. Had they been providing what they claim to, they\\'d have been able to alert housekeeping that my green \"make up room\" light had been on for nine hours. I don\\'t really care if my bed gets made, but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door, à call (and voicemail) to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where I was assured the room was serviced, that\\'s just bad management. \\n\\n\\nPost script: I was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 9:30 and 10:30 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room. I did not so much mind being awakened by their work, as much as terrified when -- after id dozed back off -- they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for DO NOT DISTURB. I called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where I left a voicemail. It\\'s like no one is in charge of this place. Not hospitable. \\n\\n The gym is decent and security, bellmen and casino personnel were all lovely.',\n",

One dissapointing part though.. the smore bread pudding i was so excited for, completely not what i was expecting. It was basically two less dense chocolate brownies with a graham cracker sitting on top and marshmallow ice cream. Of course it tasted good but I wouldn've thought it would be a bread pudding with a graham cracker crust or something, not just a graham cracker thrown on top.

When they opened up shop in Brewery town, I quickly bookmarked Spot and waited for a burger craving to hit me to give it a try.\\n\\nSpot is on West Girard Ave and I was able to find parking easily and close by on a Sunday night. The space is clean and bright with tables in the front, and back. There is also counter seating. There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.\\n\\nThe people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.\\n\\nI went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces. \\n\\nWe ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy. They were very good fries but Sketch still has my favorite fries. We had a couple of Fanta sodas too, which was pretty cool. All of our food came out surprisingly fast.\\n\\nSpot is very high up on my burger list and very close to Sketch. Spot lived up to the hype and is really cool little place in an up and coming section of the city. I will be back and probably soon. 4 plus Yelps.\",\n",

I only ordered a cheesesteak with fried onions...admittedly without looking at the menu..and when he told me it was $8.90, I thought I jumped into a wormhole and was in South Philly at Pat's or Geno's. Let me just jump to my summation...it wasn't worth $8.90. Did they pass a new cheesesteak tax too??? It's all good and lesson learned. I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards. Hell..they even charge more for SPENDING more. Who does that????\",\n",

I was however scared to death to descend the the very steep staircase that led to the private room teetering on my heels. I held the railing for dear life.\\n\\nOnce downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it.

Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement. \\n\\nAlso I was so damn hot I couldn't stay down there.

       "  'text': 'I guess I\\'m listed as a \"picky\" reviewer on Yelp, but this place could be 4 stars if they would address the service problems.\\nWalked in at 7:30, gave the name and waited. Soon there were over a dozen people standing in the waiting area for tables. After 15 minutes the lady I gave my name to came over and asked what the name was again. I asked if we could sit at the 2 top that had been vacant since we walked in and she looked at the empty table and said sure. Ok, but why couldn\\'t we be seated before that??? I do want to add that in between taking names, she was answering the phone, pouring coffee, ringing up checks and bussing tables. This place sorely needs a host or hostess. The couple that came in right behind us waited over 20 minutes to be seated, AND there was another 2 top open behind us. I don\\'t get it. Anyway, the waiter came by, opened the wine and told us about the specials. I guess its picky if you want the wine opened and then given a few minutes to relax before hearing the specials. Anyway, another man came by several minutes later and asked if we were told the specials. We asked for a few minutes and he was very nice and said sure no problem. I will get to the food, but you have to read what else took place to understand why they need someone to co-ordinate the staff. A waitress brought the appetizers and when we were almost done, yet another waitress brought us bread with dipping sauce. Been nice to get the bread first. The dinner was brought out by a different waitress. At the end of the meal the a waitress brought by the dessert cart , which we passed on. The original waiter stopped by to ask about dessert, I said no thanks, but we would like the check. In between we kept trying to get someone\\'s attention because we had asked to take part of an entree home. The waiter was way to busy and basically blew us off, one of the waitress\\' also passed by, but we couldn\\'t get her to stop. Finally the man that seemed to be the manager came by and he took care of it.\\nOk, that\\'s the bad news and maybe they were shorthanded , but a lot of other Yelpers note the same problem with service issues. People shouldn\\'t have to sit and wait 15-30 minutes for a table. If this wasn\\'t BYO, then you could always go sit at a bar and have a drink. The other thing is, no one offered to open the wine while we were waiting,as many BYO\\'s will do if they can\\'t seat you on time. Nor, did anyone say sorry about the wait.\\nThe food was very good, even as picky as I am. The shrimp tempura was serving of 5 very large gulf shrimp atop a very flavorful asain slaw. The duo, which consists of a crabcake slider and a sirloin slider was great. The crabcake was moist and had ample pieces of lump crabmeat. The sirloin slider was excellent, could of eaten a lot of those. The entree\\'s were also top notch. The special Grouper with beans and crab was moist, cooked perfectly and had a nice red pepper sauce on the bottom.\\nAs most of the reviews talk about here, the Lobster ravioli is as good as anywhere in this area. The pasta was light, the ravioli was stuffed with lobster meat and the sauce was great.\\nLike I said, take care of the service and seating issues and this is a 4 star. They do have their own lot, but you probably will have to park across the street if it\\'s a weened night. I was glad I put this address in the nav system because at night and the first time there it\\'s a little hard to find.\\nWill give them another try in hopes the service improves.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This is an excellent restaurant, and an excellent addition to the neighborhood around Rittenhouse. We dined here last night, and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back, and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt.\",\n",

I can\\'t say anything special about the drinks- they weren\\'t specially strong and even for the holiday there was no \"special\" drink (like how about a \"memorial mai tai\"?) \\nAlthough there were a good many people there you could still walk around, dance if the notion grabbed you and *bonus* they had misters so it didn\\'t feel too hot (not good for my lobster-lookin\\' body right now though!).\\n\\nI have no idea about the nightclub as I have never been but I have heard many a stories about this place.\\n\\nGreat party hotel, where you can catch some rays, some drinks and some late nights dancing.',\n",

We were seated next to the huge fish tank, which is like getting a front row seat at a concert. \\nFor an appetizer, we started with the seared scallops, which were delicious. For dinner, my wife ordered the mahi and I had the grouper piccata. Both were great.  After dinner, we almost made a big mistake because we weren't sure if we were going to have dessert. Thankfully, our server, Jen Fig, told us that there was a new pastry chef who makes all the desserts in-house. Jen raved about the chef's newest creation, a lemon meringue cheesecake which I don't even think is on the menu yet. We had to try it and it seriously turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was such a great way to end our evening. Thank you Jen!  I look forward to returning soon.\",\n",

The spicy tuna roll was stuffed with filling hardly any rice. The yellowtail roll was pure flakes and no fish. The miso was good though. Fresh and a good amount of miso. I asked for extra ginger, was on the receipt, and received none. So if you want miso check out if you know anything about sushi pass. Delivery was an hour, I was told 20 minutes.

       "  'text': \"I just moved to St Petersburg from IL and am still finding my way around.  A friend was in town and after a day at Busch Gardens we were starved.  I remembered seeing Tsunami when  I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing.  I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table.  I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant.  I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.  There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly.  Not the servers fault.  The portions were huge!  I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day.  I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned.  I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet.  All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.  While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends.  It was an enjoyable experience and a good value.\",\n",

There is only ONE table that can seat up to 8 people. We went in, she told us that the previous party has been sitting there for a while and would be done at any minuet. She also told us that we would be the next people to sit down. We thought, great! since they were putting on their coats and getting ready to leave.\\n\\nAfter the staff was finished cleaning up the dishes from the table, the host sat down A PARTY OF THREE PEOPLE. that also, CAME AFTER US!!! I just don't get it. There were plenty of other tables available, so why sit a party of 3 at the only table that can comfortably sit 8? \\n\\nI understand going to Honey's with a party of 7 isnt the smartest idea, but when the hostess tells us that we would be next in line for that large table,and then sits 3 people, that is the dumbest thing ever.\\n\\nNeedless to say,I am never going there again.

They sit you down with a good sized menu, and you get to order whatever you want, as much as you want. They prefer if you start out with an appetizer or something, because the sushi is made to order, and depending on how busy it is (every table was occupied at noon today), you\\'ll have a bit of a wait for it. The lunch was $9.99 per person. I don\\'t know how you can possibly beat that! I did not care for the ginger dressing on my salad. It tasted quite bitter to me. I also didn\\'t really care for my tempura banana. It was more of a texture thing for me. Once a banana gets heated up, it gets very mushy. Everything else was delicious.

I was not at all pleased with the chocolate cake (i love cake) BUT my friends bread pudding was pretty tasty!  \\n\\nWe will definitely return.  Our server Melissa was really sweet too!',\n",

       "  'text': \"Summary: terrible value, unreasonable wait times, extremely inattentive service staff, and perhaps worst of all, smooth jazz. \\n\\nWhen I read some of the reviews on here, I feel like I must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else. My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.\\n\\nNow, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That's it.\\n\\nThe staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn't know when we'd see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn't make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.\\n\\nThe ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren't showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don't really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I'm eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist's waiting room.\\n\\nThe food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a 'bowl' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it's organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn't go home hungry. And that's exactly what I did. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.\\n\\nObviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn't recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I must have missed the memo.  When did Chili's get much better?  I haven't been in a Chili's in years and begrudgingly went to dinner here.  I was surprised to see a nice, modern looking restaurant.  All of the tchotchkes hanging from the wall/ceiling (ala Cracker Barrell) I'm used to seeing at Chili's were gone and the place looked really nice.  They had a special that we happily took advantage of.  For $20 two people can split an appetizer (hello bottomless chips and salsa!) and then each get a full-sized entree.  That is one good deal and the food wasn't half bad either!  The most impressive thing to me were the touchscreen units that were present on each table.  It's so annoying when you are done with your meal and want to leave but can't because you either haven't gotten the bill or the server hasn't come back with your credit card.  When we were ready to go I was able to swipe my credit card in the unit, select a tip amount, and get a printed receipt.  It couldn't have been faster or more efficient.  The touchscreens also can serve as a distraction for your children.  For a buck you can let them play Peggle, Bejeweled, etc.  Sure you could argue that you could just buy those games on your phone for a dollar, but your phone isn't tied up while the kids are playing.  I think it's brilliant!  This was a surprisingly good experience.\",\n",

It was hard to hear them call your order and hear each other talk. It was a nice day so we sat outside. They need to label the plasticware holders. You can't tell if you're grabbing a knife, fork or spoon. Also the need an outside trash can. We had to go back inside during the crowed rush to throw our trash out.

       "  'text': \"I tried Las Cazuelas recently, after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere.  The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.\\n\\nI decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.\\n\\nI will not be going back.  I have had MUCH better Mexican off of the trucks in South Philly.\",\n",

The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However, they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn\\'t see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn\\'t for her in a very rude tone. Next, two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter, a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn\\'t for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone\\'s view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the \"show.\" \\nHe then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down, she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude.

It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.\\n\\nService:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.\\n\\nFood:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.\\n\\nOverall:  I would certainly come back.

If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING!

After giving me my total I asked for a bottle water, he seemed bothered that he had add something else to my order.

I was very wrong. The sushi burrito is perfection. It is the perfect lunch because it's fresh and light. The serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh. \\n\\nIt is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like. I would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture. The tuna is definitely my favorite! Overall, it's an awesome lunch spot. Highly recommend.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. \\n\\nActually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. \\n\\nThe food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.\",\n",

Her face immediately changed, she said \"oh...\", and handed me 3 menus...for 8 people.

He rolled his eyes while turning to get more, and just dumped them on the table.\\n\\nSomething similar to this has seriously happened almost every other time!

       "  'text': \"What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I've been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.\\n\\nLike Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  \\n\\nAs serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Since moving to Fishtown this summer, my other half and I have had a few meals at Lloyd, and we consider it to be one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood.\\n\\nMeal favorites: For Sunday brunch, I loved the McLloyd - pancakes smothered in maple syrup with eggs, cheese, and sausage - perfect if you like sweet and savory together for breakfast. He had the Cuban Benedict special, which had an excellent flavor. They have great food specials for dinner and brunch, but some of our dinner favorites include the savory chicken waffle small plate (shareable) and the Lloyd Burger.  \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with drinks. The bourbon sweet tea is amazing, and the Manhattan was one of the best I've ever had. We have also tried some of their whiskey flights, which are reasonably priced and great whiskeys that we might not have otherwise stumbled upon. Last but not least, they have great happy hour specials, and the classic Citywide shot and beer combo. \\n\\nThis is a great spot any day of the week. We enjoy the low key atmosphere and friendliness of the waitstaff and bartenders.\",\n",

We got in around 5 and were pretty hungry, so we went to look for a place with good food that wasn't too touristy. We stumbled across this place and decided to give it a shot. We sat in the restaurant area since I'm underage, but I liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was really nice as well.\\n My dad liked the beer and I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The portions were huge. I've never had barbeque made with vinegar sauce but I really liked it. For dessert, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. Now, I'm from Southern California and I have tried red velvet before, but I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. I decided to give it another try since I was on the east coast. Best. Decision. Ever. I finally understood what Red Velvet is supposed to taste like. It was delicious! I felt like my sight had been restored and I could finally see what I had been missing out on. \\nI was surprised to find such a great place so close to our hotel. I wish we could have stayed here longer so I could have tried more of the menu.\",\n",

SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.\\n\\nThey have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It\\'s really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn\\'t the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it\\'s all flavor.  \\n\\nDry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.\\n\\nSeveral reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It\\'s just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.  \\n\\nAbsolute top notch rating for this place.  Love it!',\n",

       "  'text': \"We came here for dinner on the recommendation of a friend of a friend, who loves it and has been here multiple times.  We liked the idea of ordering a bunch of small plates to share.  It didn't disappoint--everything was delicious and lovingly presented.  We ended up ordering the goat cheese and basil bruschetta (mild but tasty); figs stuffed with blue cheese and served over prosciutto (rich and pungent); calimari (which I didn't try); fennel sausage (tender and flavorful); two of the cheeses (one was an amazing triple creme; can't remember the other one); and the chocolate torte.  The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.       \\n\\nIt's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant, which we had anticipated.  The bill came to $80 for five small plates, a cheese board with two cheeses, and two glasses of wine (i.e., a moderate amount of food for dinner for two people).  You could obviously tweak this depending on your appetite, your budget, or your mood.  It would be a great place to just drop in for a snack. \\n\\nWe ate at one of the cafe tables on the sidewalk, which made for a really pleasant evening.  The service was good but was attentive to the point of being slightly overbearing.  But on the whole this was a very fine meal.  Thank you!\",\n",

She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she\\'s not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I\\'m jealous!  \\n\\nAs is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one\\'s hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two \"stalls\" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!\\n\\nWhen the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia\\'s injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I\\'m not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It\\'s a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   \\n\\nThe dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.   The lamb was a big disappointment, it was a little sour (bad?).  The collard greens were pretty standard, nothing amazing.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Beautiful shop; hands down one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's very modern and chic in a way. Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV! \\n\\nWe couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)\\n\\nTo get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fiancée's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.\\n\\nIffy on whether or not we'll be back. I want to like this place, but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking.\",\n",

On a recent weekend trip to Philly, we stayed at the Hotel Monaco, parked our car, and enjoyed the area. Because our weekend was packed with family events, Red Owl offered a place for us to stop in for a quick bite or drink, without the stuffy hotel bar/restaurant feel.  \\n\\nIn a three day period, we somehow managed to experience happy hour, drinks, and brunch. The charcuterie platter was substantial and thoughtfully crafted, the perfect pair to a locally brewed pint. Also recommended: the donuts.\\n\\nBrunch menu items range from healthy to traditional; the potatoes are delicious. Note that the bloody marys are chock full of horseradish--I enjoy a spicy bloody, but we had to order extra tomato juice to balance the flavor.\\n\\nAll in all, Red Owl took the guesswork out of navigating the neighborhood between events, offering variety and friendly service to keep us coming back.',\n",

This was more of just a normal sandwich on nice thick bread. It also came with lettuce, tomato and onions on it, which I was not aware came with the panini.

I\\'ve been here a few times with them and have never been impressed, but after today felt the need to write about it.\\n\\nUsually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don\\'t feel like I\\'m over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I\\'ve never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. \\n\\nAfter confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him \"no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?\" I won\\'t quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that\\'s the normal portion size but the chef doesn\\'t know what he\\'s doing and that\\'s why it looks small. \\n\\nThis was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I\\'ve eaten here in the past have been a solid \"Meh\".',\n",

I wasn\\'t looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn\\'t the first time they \"miscounted\" (in the past I\\'ve been shorted on wings and shrimps)\\ntonight is the last time I\\'m ever eating/drinking here and i will no longer be recommending people to come here.',\n",

I'm thinking I'm getting a veggie burger nope it's just onions peppers mushroom on a bun. Super disgusting! It was almost $50 for us to eat at a fast food joint and the food was gross!  I could have went to Mcdonalds and had dessert lunch and breakfast for that price and had a better meal. My husband used to work at a 5 guys in SC and as I remember the fries came with the burger as a meal fresh in a bag and the burgers were huge!

This restaurant is extremely small, and if there aren\\'t any seats, you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating, in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat, but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up, and had to ask if we could sit there, even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat, and a young,brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn\\'t even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn\\'t ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was \"so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?\". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it.

First I got in contact with Chelsea Kaplan, the events coordinator, who was so helpful and responsive throughout the planning process.  She always answered my emails right away and made sure that everything was perfect on the day of.  We had the front room for 30 people, and it was a perfect amount of space.  We were all close and cozy without being overcrowded.  It really was such a lovely day!\\n\\nI chose to have fresh fruit and Danish, orange juice carafes for the champagne I brought for mimosas, and a choice of three entrees for the guests.  Everyone was very happy with the food, which came out really quickly after ordering.  Our main server was Jess, who was AWESOME.  Our other server (I want to say Molly... she is the assistant to Dan) was also AWESOME.  They were so nice and personable and really concerned with making sure everything was perfect.\\n\\nThe planning was easy, the staff is wonderful, the food is great, the restaurant is adorable and in a great location.  I would recommend to anyone planning an event that they check out West Ave Grille.  It is laid back and intimate.\",\n",

Trying to navigate the deli bar was extremely frustrating BUT it was not for the workers. Some people just do not understand the concept of pulling numbers and then stepping out of the way to be polite. However, the workers behind the counter were poised and courteous despite the onslaught. The great staff stood out in other areas as well! In the wine room and the cheese room I was helped by two men who were eager to answer questions, hold a conversation about their respective areas, and make me feel great even though I had little knowledge. I never felt rushed and I felt well-taken care of even though I was young and I definitely don't look rich. \\nGreat place. When I am back in town I will definitely keep going for the section of foods and service. \\n\\nDeli food: 4/5- Great for how inexpensive and mass made it is. Nothing really made me excited but it all tasted good. \\nGelato: 4/5- Small varieties but very tasty. \\nCheese: 5/5 - There's so much cheese! And the guy behind the counter really knows his stuff and will help you understand the differences between all those stinky rinds!\\nWine: 5/5- Good selection and multiple staff members seemed to know what they were talking about, including the location and story of many wineries. \\nMarket: 5/5- tons of imported items and variety. \\n\\nBottom line: It's crowded but worth it. Probably best to skip lunch time on the weekends if you don't like crowds. Very helpful staff. Will be a repeat customer.\",\n",

Since I was a kid, I grew up with my best friends' family who are from Calabria. Their mom and grandma (spoke no English) would spoil us with the very beat home made Italian food I've ever had. She used to make multiple pizzas every Saturday...and placed a huge emphasis on the dough. Any true Italian always uses good bread and good dough for their food. With that being said, Vincent's is the best Pizza you can find outside of south Philly or center city. Very good dough and good use of cheese and sauce.

Unfortunately, this place feels as though it is one step away from going out of business.  The positive were the prices.  Decent prices.  The hotel does have some cool architecture but it has been neglected.  The place smells musty.  The rooms are nice though.\\n\\nIt is kind of sad because I see a lot of potential in this place under some good management.  \\n\\nThe overall negative was the staff.  Every single person we came into contact with was clueless. It feels like they are running on a skeleton staff. You are always waiting and waiting for someone to help you.  The wait-staff in all areas is slow and confuse. The only good waiter was Michael in the restaurant.  He is very nice and professional.  Ask for Michael if you are eating in.  \\n\\nThe food was not very good either.  The burgers were overcooked and the calamari was greasy.  The steak was weird and rubbery, but the salmon was decent.  \\n\\nWith the low prices brings a slightly wild crowd.  The pool gets a little wild on the weekends.  \\n\\nThe spa could be nice, but the massage prices are way too high.  You can go just down the road for something just as good for half the price.  They charged $170 for an 80 minute massage.  That's about as high as it gets.  The massage was decent but you can find cheaper within walking distance.  Nancy gives a decent massage.  \\n\\nIf I had extra money and time, I would buy this place and whip it into shape because I see so much potential.  Unfortunately, I would not go back unless it was under new management.  By the end of the trip, it was just too much.  The place was dirty and the staff was bad.  We should have stayed home.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Couple of notable impressions:\\n\\n- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.\\n\\n- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?\\n\\n- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.\\n\\n- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.\\n\\n- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\n- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.\\n\\n- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.\",\n",

We asked for sweet and low with one of our unsweet teas and didn't receive it. Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip.

Don't get me wrong, your food was decent- the Crudo was tasty and the rotolo was great but I guess the hype prior to meeting you was just a bit oversold. \\n\\nService: Meh. everyone there seemed really bored and the vibe was a bit bland. \\n\\nSeating: I sat at the counter because I dislike communal seating unless I'm at a bar. I recommend this option if you don't want to sit near someone else's hangry toddler or if you just want to watch the pizza making magic.\\n\\nFood: Decent. The pizza (I got the Crudo) was good and rotolo was really good but my pizza was a bit too oily and was barely warm. Other then that, the thin crust style pizza was well executed and all of the ingredients were fresh. The prosciutto wasn't overly salty and the sauce was lovely.\\n\\nI will probably go back soon to try a bit more from the menu since there were a lot of things that were appealing like the Melanzana and Salsiccia pizzas or the Nutella Pizza for dessert, yum.  \\n\\nTo be continued...\",\n",

There were about as many chips as you would find in a lays snack pack! The rosemary was very strong, but I like rosemary so I didn't mind. My friend had the pesto bruschetta. If you love pesto, this is the snack for you. It came with two very small pieces of bread with a small amount of goat cheese but absolutely loaded with pesto. The stuff was dripping off. My friend actually had to take some off because it was overwhelming. The atmosphere at Tría is nice and the staff are relatively friendly.

I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We\\'re not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it\\'s close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \"do you mind if we sit here..\" and was cut off. He said, \"I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who\\'s worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn\\'t have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \"that man was so rude\". It\\'s unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She\\'s already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I\\'m mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely.',\n",

I've had Thai from a lot of the places around Brandon and typically I wind up disappointed.....most places aren't authentic and just really lack. This was not the case for Jasmine Thai. The main reason I took the star is because their crab rangoons were a bit dry. But my husband had the Chicken Basil and I had the Chicken Panang Curry and they were both wonderful. Also I must comment on the decor inside, they could use new carpeting but other than that it was one of the nicest Thai restaurants I've seen.\",\n",

It is right next to where H-Mart  begins, across from Paris Baguette.They have an incredible selection of delicious hot and cold prepared foods.Outstanding choices to die for are the spicy chicken pieces(breast) w/sweet & sour sauce, wings(rival Cafe Soho, but cheaper), and the spicy blue  crab soup.Everything I have tried here has been nothing short of fresh and delicious. Other items you can't go wrong with are the Soft Tofu Seafood Soup, japchae,(although I prefer the H-mart japchae cause you get like twice as much for the same price),the fried squid,gimbap, box lunches, mak kimchi,and savory pancakes.\\n\\nTheir prices are incredibly reasonable with most things $5-$6. The box lunches are $6 and I had an amazing one last week consisting of Beef Bulgogi, Rice, Kimchi, Japchae, 2 pan fried savory dumplings and one sweet fried thing that I had no idea what it was 'cept it was incredible! I think it was some type of deep-fried flour-type ball of goodness.I'm still dreaming of that lunch. Not all items are always available. There sometimes is a bit of a language barrier; however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can.\\n\\nI always check in on this place when I shop @ H-Mart to see if they have the Spicy Blue Crab soup. Today I lucked out and they had some. There was a woman who was buying like 10 qts. of the stuff. Turns out she is taking back home to Wisconsin to freeze it. You know it's special when folks come from out of state to buy it.\\n\\nSome of their foods are pretty spicy for occidental palates; but isn't that what Korean food is supposed to be? I love this place!\",\n",

They had 1 waitress for all 33 people, she was MIA for long periods of time, & told my mom she was bogged down with other tables & patrons. 2 people waited an hour & a half for their first drink & when I told the waitress that, she sat stone-faced like she had no idea what to do or say. (We had opened a tab for our guests so all orders needed to be handled by the waitress). I'm assuming she ended up asking for help because a more pleasant girl came up to take orders, bring food, refill water pitchers, etc towards the end of the night. In short, they did not staff for the event & it quickly became stressful & disappointing.

I went there recently and ordered coffee, and clearly stated that I wanted it with no sugar.  The girl at the window handed me the coffee, which was loaded with sugar.  I went through again, and asked for what I ordered.  Another employee gave me another coffee, made as I originally ordered, but she made no apology, and seemed annoyed.

       "  'text': \"I come to Dagwoods all the time with friends and family. The food and service is great! This family owned restaurant really makes you feel at home. \\n\\nWe started with some drinks and seafood apps. The clams in white were awesome! Perfect flavor and consistency. The broth was so good, I wanted to treat it as if it were soup. We also got some crabs to share, they were a good size and were warm and cleaned. \\n\\nI chose to get one of the specials, the Salmon, and WOW was I impressed. It was cooked so perfectly. A slight crunch on the outside (not burnt) and juicy on the inside. It was honestly the best salmon I ever had. There was a corn succotash on top and it came with orzo, because I can't have gluten I chose to sub broccoli. \\n\\nI am impressed with Dagwoods every time I come. They never fail to amaze and create a great experience weather it's your first time or you're a regular.\",\n",
